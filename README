To produce a PDF of the sample from scratch, you need to run LaTeX
once on the sample to generate the correct bibliography entries.
Then you need to run bibTeX to generate the bibliography.  Then you
need to run LaTeX to generate all of the correct cross-references,
entries in the table of contents, and the bibliography.  Then you
can convert it from a DVI file to a PDF file.

On a Unix machine:

% latex gusample
% bibtex gusample
% latex gusample
% latex gusample
% dvipdf gusample

See the file latex-tutorial.pdf for help with LaTeX.  See
http://www.tug.org for help with LateX distributions.

Pointers appear in gusample.tex, and template.tex is a skeleton
document.
