\chapter{Conclusion}
This thesis explores the challenge of designing privacy-preserving systems for home IoT devices. It reviews currently available home IoT devices, their privacy threats and the need for a privacy-preserving framework.

This thesis next proposes a privacy-preserving framework for generalized home IoT devices by combining Tor with IoT systems. We present different attacker models, security guarantees and usability features of such framework.

Then, it presents a case study which focuses on the detailed design and implementation of a specific type of home IoT systems - an Internet-enabled doorbell. We proposed the system design and implemented the system on a RaspberryPi computer. We also did experiments and analysis to argue the implemented system's usability.

Finally, we discuss  open questions that are not covered in this thesis, including better traffic cover mechanism, completely decentralized push notification service, distributed storage and different communication models.
