\begin{abstract}

IoT (Internet-of-Things) devices have seen widespread deployment over the past decade. Since they make home appliances able to connect to the Internet, IoT services have made daily life much more convenient. However, on the other hand, they have also made home appliances open to the public on the Internet and thus have introduced vulnerabilities and threats to user privacy that were previously not possible on disconnected devices. Security and privacy incidents of IoT devices have been reported every year, and the topic has received worldwide? attention from ??? security researchers and IoT manufacturers.

This thesis first surveys the background of IoT devices, including what is provided on the market and the feature sets of existing products. We then look at existing studies which discuss the security and privacy threats of IoT systems. Besides, we also review previous research related to IoT anonymity.

The main contribution of the thesis is a privacy-preserving framework for generalized IoT devices by utilizing the Tor network. The framework is designed to defense against the vulnerabilities and threats mentioned above. It offers security and privacy while supporting the features of offered by modern IoT devices and is suitable for typical home networks. We also propose communication and attacker models in this scenario and the framework's security and usability features.

Finally, we conduct a case study, which focuses on a specific type of IoT system, namely Internet-enabled video doorbells. We implement a privacy-preserving doorbell system using the proposed design, evaluate its usability and compare it with existing products.
