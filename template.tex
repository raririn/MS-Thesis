\begin{abstract}

IoT devices have been widely deployed in today's society. Since it makes home appliances able to connect to the Internet, IoT services have made daily life much more convenient. However, on the other hand, they have also made home appliances open to the public on the Internet, and thus introduce vulnerabilities and threats to user privacy. In fact, security and privacy incidents of IoT devices have been reported every year, and it has become a increasingly serious problem for researchers.

This thesis first surveys the background of IoT devices, including what is provided on the market and the feature sets of existing products. We then look at existing studies which discuss security and privacy threat of IoT systems. In addition, we also review previous research related to IoT anonymity.

Next, we propose a privacy-preserving framework for generalized IoT device by utilizing the Tor network. We also propose communication and attacker models in this scenario, and state security and usability features of the framework.

Finally, we conduct a case-study, which focuses on a specific type of IoT system, namely Internet-enabled video doorbells. We implement a privacy-preserving doorbell system using the proposed design, evaluate its usability and compare it with existing products.
